# About the ALY Launch

Ultimatlely, we have decided to launch Alloy by IFO with our own protcol solution, AlloyPad. Based on our analysis, the Alloypad has the fairest respective outcome of our possible methods of launch

### Decision Specs and our choices

Liquidity mining implies a typical farm launch, earning an allocation of xToken per block. Now, say Alloy was to launch ALY with a small supply (relative to xToken/Block), what we then have is an emission schedule based on a logarithmic function, in which inflation based on percentages is incredibly intensive the first days after launch, leading to price volatility and impermanent losses.

On the other hand, the disadvantage of fair launching with a larger supply in an attempt to offset inflation rate, is unfair distribution. This is why we are ultimately launching ALY on our own crowdfunding launchpad: a fair solution that serves as a proof of product for the AlloyPad. Users will be able to deposit Wrapped Fuse in return of a share of the ALY allocated to the presale.

**Timeline**
------------

####  March 7, 10 PM (UTC);

The ALY presale on the AlloyPad goes live. Alloy website will launch roughly 30 minutes before the presale takes place. 400,000 ALY will be up for grabs over a period of 48hs. We aim to raise $50,000 in FUSE tokens, setting the price per ALY to $0.133.

####  March 9, 10 PM (UTC);

80% of the FUSE raised from the presale will be paired to 300,000 ALY tokens, while 20% will be used to cover development costs. Until rewards from Masterchef and Smartchef go live, FUSE's team will verify the contracts on the FUSE Explorer, apply for a Rugdoc review, and burn the ALY-FUSE liquidity. Meanwhile, users that participated in the presale will be able to farm with ALY on partnered FUSE yield farms and DEXes (VOLT).

## How to participate

1. Wrap your FUSE tokens (A link will be provided both as an announcement and on the platform)
2. Visit the AlloyPad on Alloy's website (On the Launchpad Tab)
3. Input the amount of WFUSE you would like to contribute, and do so.
