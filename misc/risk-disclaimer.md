# Risk Disclaimer

**Always do your own research.**

There are risks involved when interacting with projects in the decentralized finance space. Although we are doing our best to secure our smart contracts, there is always a risk of a potential exploit. You must be aware that getting MIS (and by extension any crypto, especially volatile DeFi tokens and smaller projects) carries a risk of loss of value. 

Be aware of the risks of impermanent loss** **when farming with two volatile assets. Resources that cover this topic are abundantly available on the internet - To briefly summarize, if you farm with two assets, and one of them significantly rises or falls in value over the other token, you will suffer an impermanent loss of the second token. This is the case with any AMM (automated market maker) liquidity pool system. 

Never use more than you can lose - you alone are responsible for your finances. Artemis Protocol and its developers are not responsible for any losses or changes in token price, and not responsible for any lost funds due to smart contract error or exploits. Artemis Protocol should not be considered an investment, but as an experiment, there are not any guarantees or promises about the functionality or delivery of features and we reserve the right to disable or remove any features.
