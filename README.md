# Intro

AlloyPad is a multi-product DeFi protocol built on the Fuse Blockchain **striving to incubate protocols developing and launching on in the Fuse community.** By kickstarting these projects, Alloy aims to create on chain liquitidty whil still maintaining DeFi's decentralized and permissionless nature (all while providing desirable APRs!).

We intend to foster a tightly knit Fuse community by building an ecoststem with new rising projects and, all while offering our own wide range of DeFi solutions.
