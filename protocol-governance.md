# Governance Model

Alloy plans to be governed by its community members, first via forum discussions and voting proposals held on the upcoming Alloy Snapshot. With the implementation of xALY (a vested version of ALY), we aim to make of it the core of Alloy governance, until that point, ALY will serve as the gateaway to Alloy Governance.

Although not an easy task by any means, our goal is to establish a DAO, with working trustless governance. There are at this time no time estimates for when this can be accomplished. We encouvrage discussion how the future DAO should work by participating on our Discord or Telegram server!
