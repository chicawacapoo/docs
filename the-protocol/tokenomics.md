# ALY

The foundation of Alloy Protocol is based on the ALY token. Its the gate-away to our decentralized application and to our Governance system. Participants wishing to utilize any of Alloy's products will need to posses the ALY token.

## Supply and Emission Schedule

1,000,000 ALY tokens will be pre-minted, of which:

* **400,000 MIS:** Allocated to the AlloyPad sale to be fairly distributed.
* **300,000 MIS:** Allocated for initial liquidity. These tokens will be paired with Wrapped FUSE to form the initial liquidity pool and will be sent to a dead address as a safety measure.
* **200,000 MIS:** Allocated to a multi-sig wallet that will be controlled by 2 founding developers and 2 3rd party trusted community members. It will be used to cover the cost of hires and marketing.
* **100,000 MIS:** Allocated for pre-launch bounties and the Bountry Hunter Program after launch of the initial liquidity pool.

ALY has no hard cap, however, as our ecosystem grows, we aim to grow our deflationary mechanisms and attempt to stay below a set threshold. We strive to create enough utility and demand in our other dapps to create a natural inflation control mechanism. In an ideal case, once our whole ecosystem is in place, we can express it as,

$$
∀m,∃n/n≥m
$$

`Where (m = ALY emmited per block) and (n = ALY being burnt)`

{% hint style="info" %}
1.09% will be burnt periodically. 2% will be allocated to cover marketing costs and airdrops and 4% will be allocated to cover developer hours and bounties.
