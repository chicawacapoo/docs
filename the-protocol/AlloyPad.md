# AlloyPad

### Introduction

The AlloyPad is a token launchpad for newly developed projects in the Fuse ecosystem and is our most fundamental DeFi solution. We aim to decentralize the way ideas raise capital, by aligning the interests of both users and creators via attractive incentives and yields.&#x20;

The AlloyPad allows projects to allocate tokens at a fixed price, which will be maintained for the duration of the sale offering. This ensures less volatility around a token launch and allows a project and its investors increased transparency over the amount of money raised and tokens sold. Our fixed price offering aims to solve 3 fundamental problems with Token launches:

1. Unfair token distribution and liquidity rug-pulls.
2. Prevents token dumps by private and seed investors.
3. Reduces token offering costs on decentralized exchanges.

Proejects wishing to launch on Alloy will be reviewed and auditted by the Alloy team, as well as screened by leading members of the Fuse DAO.

### User Workflow

Users lock MIS as collateral in order to be whitelisted during the sale, these then commit Wrapped ONE to buy the tokens being sold. The system follows an overflow sales method, in which users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the token sale, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale. In the case all the funds targeted aren't raised, the sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent.

### What happens after launch?

Projects wishing to launch on Artemis will not only be able to raise capital for liquidity and to cover development costs, but also will be rewarded for it by Artemis, this includes taking part in our incubator and incentivized liquidity pools, as well as being able to apply to the Artemis Hunt incentives program.
