# Incubator

The Incubator is the core of Alloy's fair token distribution capabilities for new projects. Our vision is for it to become the go-to liquidity as a service solution, where project owners set up farms in a permissionless manner to distribute their tokens.&#x20;

Say Roland is working on a project and launched her coin ($ROL). Understandably, wants to fairly distribute it to holders while building liquidity for it, what Roland could do is visit Alloy, and seamlessly set up a ALY<>ROLD farm that rewards farmers in ALI. Alloy governance would then review ROL and flag the project based on a set criteria.


We will release more information on the Incubator in upcoming days.
