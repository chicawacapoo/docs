# Roadmap

### Phase 1 **—** Launch

Launch will see the creation of Alloy. Our main focus will be developing an active community, which one day will become the leaders of our DAO and Governance. We will launch the first draft of our official Documentation and Alloy landing website, which will serve as a gateaway to our Dapp. What follows is marketing and outreach, by partnering with youtubers, community members and AMAs across all social media. We will work relentlessly until every FUSE community member to knows what Alloy Protocol is.

### Phase 2 **—** Governance

This will see the launch of ALY, our ERC20 governance token with the first glance to one of Alloy's most fundamental products. The launch will partake on the Alloy Launchpad and users will be able to participate in the token sale for 2 whole days by commiting wrapped FUSE, \~2 blocks before the presale completes, we will add liquidity and immediately transfer the LP tokens to a dead address. Soon after, ALY holders will be able to earn yield with their tokens in partnered projects farms. What follows is a sequence of airdrops and giveaways through social media.
